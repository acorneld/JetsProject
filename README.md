#Lessons Learned
-Went down a hole again where I ended up re-working my code every which way when the real
mistake was not even close.  Did take some time to google the error message it was giving me
but not nearly enough.  Also tried to implement an un-needed array again.  Used the UML we were
given to sketch out everything at first but could have probably saved tons of time but drawing out the details of each class and interface before implementing them.
